Hachiko
=======

A jQuery sticky plugin that allows a relatively positioned element to be stickied onto the screen when the it is scrolled outside of the viewport. And instead of changing the position of the element on mouse scroll, this plugin creates a clone of the original element and have it fixed positioned so the original layout is always preserved.
